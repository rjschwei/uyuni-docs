= Public Cloud Setup

{productname} is pre-installed in images available in the Public Cloud. You do not need to perform any installation steps.
However, you must have the correct {productname} and {sle} entitlements to receive updates before you can manage client systems.

{productname} is only offered as bring your own subscription (BYOS) images. Entitlements are provided by {suse} or a partner, and can be obtained using the {scc}.
{sle} system images for clients are generally available in 2 flavors, on-demand images (also referred to as pay as you go - PAYG) and BYOS images. If you are managing on-demand instances the entitlement for the client itself is part of the on-demand pricing. For on-demand instances you need to do some extra preparation before you can manage the system with {productname}.

An instance started from a SUSE published on-demand instance will automatically register against and update infrastructure and all {sle} modules are activated. This automation should be disabled for systems managed with {productname}.


.Procedure: Preparing On Demand Images
. Log into the on demand instance.
. At the command prompt, as root, remove the registration data and repositories
+
---
registercloudguest --clean
---
. then remove the `cloud-regionsrv-client` package:
+
----
zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client
----
. Remove additional packages specific to your cloud provider:
+
* Amazon EC2:
+
----
zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigEC2 regionServiceCertsEC2
----
+
* Google Compute Engine:
+
----
zypper rm cloud-regionsrv-client-plugin-gce regionServiceClientConfigGCE regionServiceCertsGCE
----
+
* Microsoft Azure:
+
----
zypper rm regionServiceClientConfigAzure regionServiceCertsAzure
----

For instructions on registering {productname} to {scc}, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].



.Procedure: Activating the Public Cloud Module
. On the {productname} Server, open the {yast} management tool, and navigate to menu:Software[Software Repositories].
. Click btn:[Add] and select [guimenu]``Extensions and Modules from Registration Server``.
. In the [guimenu]``Available extensions`` field, select [guimenu]``Public Cloud Module``.

If you prefer to use the command line, you can add the module with this command:
----
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.2/x86_64
----

When the installation procedure has finished, you can check that you have all the required modules.
At the command prompt, enter:

----
SUSEConnect --status-text
----

For {productname} Server on a public cloud, the expected modules are:

* {sles} Basesystem Module
* Python 2 Module
* Server Applications Module
* Web and Scripting Module
* SUSE Manager Server Module
* Public Cloud Module



== Account Credentials

An administrator account is created by default.
The username and password varies depending on your provider.

| Provider              | Default Username  | Default Password
| Amazon EC2            | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Google Compute Engine | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Microsoft Azure       | ``admin``         |``<instance-name>``-suma
|===

You can retrieve the instance name or ID from the public cloud instance web console, or from the command prompt:

Amazon EC2:

----
ec2metadata --instance-id
----

Google Compute Engine:

----
gcemetadata --query instance --id
----

Microsoft Azure:

----
azuremetadata --compute --name
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
When you have logged in to the administrator account for the first time, change the default password to protect your account.
